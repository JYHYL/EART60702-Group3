### Overview
The LSTM model was applied to train and predict on the six MME datasets and Modle 85. The results were saved for subsequent use for stacking.

Separate Application of LSTM to the 6 MME Datasets:
The LSTM model was applied to perform daily-scale simulations on the six MME datasets, and the results were saved in Excel format within the LSTM_MME_prediction directory.

Application of LSTM to the CHESS Dataset(Model 85):
The LSTM model was applied to perform monthly-scale simulations on the CHESS Dataset, and the results were saved in Excel format within the LSTM_CHess_prediction directory.
