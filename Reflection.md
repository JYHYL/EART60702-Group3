This project allowed me to contribute more to the group, particularly in programming. Compared to project 1, I took on more responsibility and gained greater confidence in my abilities. One of the most noticeable improvements was my increased ability to work with .nc files. Although I’m not yet proficient, I have mastered the basic methods for reading and processing them. This skill will also be valuable for my upcoming ERP project, which involves similar data formats.

That said, we did face some challenges during the project. Although we completed the EDA early, we had to redo a large portion of it because we initially failed to include an additional dataset. This experience taught me the importance of thoroughly confirming all project requirements before getting started. In future projects, I plan to list all requirements in advance to avoid heading in the wrong direction and wasting time.

As for the presentation, I was still nervous, but I felt a bit more relaxed than last time — which, for me, is already an improvement.

Another major issue was that I initially misjudged the project deadline, which caused us to start late and work under time pressure. Although we managed to complete everything in the end, this taught me that confirming the deadline early is crucial to avoiding unnecessary stress and last-minute rushes.
