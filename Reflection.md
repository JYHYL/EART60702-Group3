This project allowed me to contribute more to the group, particularly in programming. Compared to project 1, I took on more responsibility and gained greater confidence in my abilities. One of the most noticeable improvements was my increased ability to work with .nc files. Although I’m not yet proficient, I have mastered the basic methods for reading and processing them. This skill will also be valuable for my upcoming ERP project, which involves similar data formats.

That said, we did face some challenges during the project. Although we completed the EDA early, we had to redo a large portion of it because we initially failed to include an additional dataset. This experience taught me the importance of thoroughly confirming all project requirements before getting started. In future projects, I plan to list all requirements in advance to avoid heading in the wrong direction and wasting time.

As for the presentation, I was still nervous, but I felt a bit more relaxed than last time — which, for me, is already an improvement.

Another major issue was that I initially misjudged the project deadline, which caused us to start late and work under time pressure. Although we managed to complete everything in the end, this taught me that confirming the deadline early is crucial to avoiding unnecessary stress and last-minute rushes.

This project experience has deepened my understanding of the complexity involved in handling meteorological data. It requires familiarity with mainstream meteorological products, the ability to retrieve and consult relevant datasets, the skill to match meteorological variables with different naming conventions through domain knowledge, and the capability to extract data with specific temporal and spatial resolutions using code. I have realized the importance of establishing a complete workflow, including early-stage knowledge preparation and supporting scripts.

Previously, some of my research group peers worked on national-scale climate change studies, others coupled reanalysis data with hydrological models for runoff simulation, and some applied algorithms to merge and evaluate satellite product data. During the initial design phase of this project, I reflected on these research directions based on the available data and developed a deeper understanding of them.

Although we ultimately selected a relatively simple prediction task, I applied the stacking method I had learned for the first time. While this was merely an initial attempt and did not improve the model’s performance, it may serve as a viable option for future applications. In terms of image selection, I also realized that it is sometimes more appropriate to choose images based on the properties we aim to highlight, rather than those that best display differences.

Throughout the course of this project, I gained practical experience in project management, including writing a README file, configuring environments, understanding the concepts of branches and the main branch, and handling pull requests. I also learned to manage the project using both Git and the GitHub web interface.
